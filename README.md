A HEADS-UP ABOUT MY GITHUB ACCOUNT

Since at my job I use a different github account, I currently find more practical to start and update personal projects at my CodePen ( http://codepen.io/andreaweb/ ). I will deff commit more and more in this github account, but for the moment it'll happen mostly at weekends and the occasional holiday. It'll happen EVERY weekend though!

I also wanna be more active in the community and collaborate in other projects. If you think I can be useful, please e-mail me at return.santana@gmail.com

Thanks!
